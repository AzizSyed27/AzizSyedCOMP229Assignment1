          <p>
            I’m currently enrolled in the{' '}
            <strong>Software Engineering Technology program</strong> at{' '}
            <span className="highlight-college">Centennial College</span> (Jan 2023 – Dec 2025),
            where I’ve maintained a <strong>4.3/4.5 GPA</strong>. My coursework and projects have
            given me hands-on experience with full-stack development, APIs, and cloud computing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve worked with technologies such as <strong>React, Angular, Node.js, Spring Boot,
            ASP.NET Core, GraphQL, MongoDB,</strong> and relational databases. I enjoy building
            applications that are both technically solid and user-focused, and I’m comfortable
            working across the stack, from UI to database and deployment.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’ve also gained exposure to modern engineering practices, including Agile/Scrum, CI/CD,
            containerization with <strong>Docker/Kubernetes</strong>, and infrastructure tools like{' '}
            <strong>Terraform</strong>. These experiences have helped me understand how reliable,
            scalable systems are built and maintained in real environments.
          </p>

          <p>
            Outside of academics, I stay involved as a <strong>peer mentor</strong>, a member of the
            <strong> Software Engineering Club</strong>, and an active participant in hackathons and
            coding competitions. I also volunteer as a sports coach and event organizer, which helps
            me strengthen teamwork, leadership, and communication skills.
          </p>
